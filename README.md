# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is that of the videogame sales This dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. It was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com. Fields include Rank - Ranking of overall sales, Name - The games name,Platform - Platform of the games release (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.), Year - Year of the game's release, Genre - Genre of the game, Publisher - Publisher of the game, NA_Sales - Sales in North America (in millions), EU_Sales - Sales in Europe (in millions), JP_Sales - Sales in Japan (in millions), Other_Sales - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions), Global_Sales - Total worldwide sales.

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a scatter plot with low opacity points and it shows the global sales of a game with respect to their platform.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Do the sales of games increase every year, if so, which publisher is gaining more popularity?
 * How much correlated are the sales of a game in different regions?
 * Does a region favor any publisher, genre or platform?
 * How many sequels or remakes have made it to the list?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions
Can rows be parsed word by word into a dictionary to find common words?
Can we take a sample set to represent the whole fairly?
