# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data visualized for my project is that of the videogame sales This dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. It was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com. Fields include Rank - Ranking of overall sales, Name - The games name,Platform - Platform of the games release (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.), Year - Year of the game's release, Genre - Genre of the game, Publisher - Publisher of the game, NA_Sales - Sales in North America (in millions), EU_Sales - Sales in Europe (in millions), JP_Sales - Sales in Japan (in millions), Other_Sales - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions), Global_Sales - Total worldwide sales.

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a scatter plot with low opacity points and it shows the global sales of a game with respect to their platform.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will be answered with help of the visualizations and interactions in vizs in this project:

 * Do the sales of games increase every year, if so, which publisher is gaining more popularity?
 * How much correlated are the sales of a game in different regions?
 * Does a region favor any publisher, genre or platform?
 * How many sequels or remakes have made it to the list?

## Sketches

The axes represent the year and total global sales, using the publisher variable as color in bar (stack). Hopefully, the number of publishers are not high making it hard for viz. The first question will be answered through this. If the bars are like a waterfall, then there is increase in sales every year. Using tooltip, we can see which stack of the bar is increasing in length, to see which publisher is gaining popularity.

For this viz, i'm considering a sample set of the data to draw conclusions. The axes are name of the game and region, with area representing the sales. If I observe a pattern like the ratio in area is same, then the sales are highly correlated. 

## Open Questions
 - Can rows be parsed word by word into a dictionary to find common words?
 - Can we take a sample set to represent the whole set fairly?

## Final Vizs and insights

This is a color legend plot which helped me to segway to the better idea to create a menu for publishers, as, in this plot of year v/s global sales of a game, we aren't able to see all the publishers.

This is a bubble plot with genre and global sales as the axes. I have added EU sales and Japan sales to compare them to the global sales. Here, we can observe that EU sales are directly proportional to the Global sales but the sales in japan show no such relation.

This is a bar plot showing the total global sales yearly by a publisher/publishers. The publishers can be chosen from the dropdown menu. As far as I have observed there is a kind of normal distribution of sales. This is, most probably, because the number of good games increased every year and the global share for each game decreased. Until 2010, the  good games were limited in number, so, they made it to top 10000.


## Future Works 
 - I will create a word search bar with autocomplete feature to find matching games to check whether they are present in the list.
